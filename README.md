# Equipment Maintenance System

# Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simple, yet robust, Python program that enables users to efficiently track and manage equipment maintenance activities. Initially, the focus will be on developing basic functionality for logging status. Subsequent iterations will introduce features for logging delicate equipment parameters and preventative maintenance records.

# Current Status
As of now, the project is in the planning and early development stage. Basic code scaffolding and project structure are being set up.
